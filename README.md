<h1>‚òïÔ∏è Scalable and Highly Available Caf√© Website on AWS</h1>

This project demonstrates how to design and deploy a **highly available, scalable, and resilient web application infrastructure** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. The goal is to ensure that the caf√©‚Äôs website can handle sudden traffic spikes, such as when featured on a major TV food show.

---

<h2>üìå Project Overview</h2>

**Objective:**  
- Build a web server architecture that automatically scales in and out based on demand.  
- Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure zero downtime and great user experience.  
- Deploy across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for fault tolerance.

**AWS Services Used:**  
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)  
- Subnets (Public and Private, across multiple AZs)  
- Internet Gateway (IGW)  
- Route Tables  
- Elastic Load Balancing (Application Load Balancer)  
- EC2 Launch Template  
- EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)  
- CloudWatch Alarms and Metrics

At the end of this project, your architecture should look like the following example:

## <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Deploy</h2>

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- **CIDR Block:** `10.0.0.0/16`
- Enable **DNS Hostnames**

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Subnets & Networking
- **Public Subnets:** For ALB (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24` and `10.0.2.0/24`)
- **Private Subnets:** For EC2 instances (e.g., `10.0.3.0/24` and `10.0.4.0/24`)
- Attach an **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
- Update **Route Tables**:
  - Public subnets route through IGW
  - Private subnets stay private

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Launch Template
- **AMI:** Amazon Linux 2023 or custom caf√© app image
- **Instance Type:** `t2.micro` (or as needed)
- **Key Pair:** Choose Create new key pair.
Tip: Create a new key pair and choose it. Make sure that you download the key pair to your local computer. For SSH access
- **Network Settings:** Auto-assign public IP = disabled
- **Security Group:** Allow HTTP (80) and SSH (22) from trusted IPs
- Optional **User Data Script** to bootstrap the caf√© app

4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Launch template: Use the created one
- Attach to VPC private subnets in multiple AZs
- Register with ALB target group
- Desired Capacity: 2 instances
- Minimum Capacity: 2
- Maximum Capacity: 6
- Automatic scaling - optional: Choose Target tracking scaling policy, and configure the following options
- Metric type: Choose Average CPU utilization.
- Target value: Enter 25
- Instance warmup: Enter 60

5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Type: **Application Load Balancer**
- Scheme: **Internet-facing**
- Subnets: Use public subnets in 2 AZs.
- **HTTPS security configuration settings**: Skip these settings.
- **Security groups**: Create a new security group that allows HTTP traffic from anywhere
- **Target group**: Create a new target group.
- **Registering targets**: Skip this section.
- Listener: HTTP on port 80

Modify the Auto Scaling group that you created in the previous task by adding this new load balancer.
Hint: Add the target group that you created in the Application Load Balancer configuration.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Setup
- Obtain the **ALB DNS name** and open in a browser.
- Verify traffic is balanced between servers.

<h2>Testing automatic scaling under load</h2>

By using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, connect to one of the running web server instances.
On the sessions manager terminal, use the following commands to start a stress test. This test increases the load on the web server CPU:

<br />

---

Verify that the Auto Scaling group deploys new instances.
Continue to observe the Amazon EC2 console.
During the test, you should observe that more web server instances are deployed.

‚úÖ Outcomes
- By following this project, you achieve:
- Automatic scalability to handle peak traffic.
- High availability across multiple AZs.
- Load balancing for optimal performance.
- Resilient architecture for real-world production scenarios.
